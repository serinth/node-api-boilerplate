# Node API Boilerplate

Tried to keep this one simple. It has:

- Express with body-parser
- ES6 and ESLint
- iSparta for CI coverage
- Pre-commit hooks
- Nodemon for `dev`
- handy `config` util built in for different environments

# Dev Environment
`npm run dev`

# Production
`npm run build`
`npm run start`

# Health and Info Endpoints
`localhost:3000/api/health`
`localhost:3000/api/info`
